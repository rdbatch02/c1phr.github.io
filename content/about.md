My name is Ryan Batchelder and I'm a software engineer building cloud-native web applications using modern technologies at Liberty Mutual Insurance. Starting with a background in C# and .NET, I moved into the Java world and was promptly disgusted by the language. This led me to Kotlin and started a trend of pitching Kotlin to anyone who would listen. I also enjoy working with Swift and Python when the opportunity arises. I got my BS in Computer Science from [Northern Arizona University](http://nau.edu/cefns). In my time away from the keyboard, I enjoy photography, hockey, and am an unapologetic aviation geek.

Feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rdbatch02) or via email, I love to talk about almost anything tech-related and I love learning from others. Also checkout my open source work on [Github](https://github.com/rdbatch02) or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rdbatch02/).

Viewpoints and opinions are my own.
